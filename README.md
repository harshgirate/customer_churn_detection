# customer_churn_detection
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn in a telecom company, helping the business identify users at risk of leaving. The model analyzes customer behavior, usage patterns, and service-related factors to provide actionable insights that support effective retention strategies.

*The dataset used for this model, provided by BlastChar on Kaggle, is available as archive.zip. I acknowledge and thank BlastChar for making the data accessible.*
